                    Computer Hardware Engg. involves study of Hardware, networking and programming. 
                    In 1997 we started Computer Hardware Maintenance and  from 2015 onwards name  and the contents of the course 
                    modified as Computer Hardware Engineering. Computer hardware diploma engineers design, develop, and test 
                    computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. 
                    With the advent of technology and advances in R&D, the scope of hardware engineering has been expanded to 
                    include hardware devices enabling embedded software engineering in non-computer devices. The scope of 
                    hardware engineering is limited not just to the designing and development of computer or embedded systems, 
                    but also to integrate the various devices for the functioning of the entire business system.With the advent 
                    of technology and advances in R&D, hardware engineering is now prevalent in newer fields such as mobile 
                    computing and distributed systems, computer vision and robotics, etc…Diploma holders in CHE branch can 
                    work areas like Hardware,Networking,programming , system admin  etc….AS in other diploma programmes 
                    short term and long term courses are available for higher studies/specialization.
