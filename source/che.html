                    Computer Hardware Engg. involves study of Hardware, networking and programming. 
                    In 1997 we started Computer Hardware Maintenance and  from 2015 onwards name  and the contents of the course 
                    modified as Computer Hardware Engineering. Computer hardware diploma engineers design, develop, and test 
                    computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. 
                    With the advent of technology and advances in R&D, the scope of hardware engineering has been expanded to 
                    include hardware devices enabling embedded software engineering in non-computer devices. The scope of 
                    hardware engineering is limited not just to the designing and development of computer or embedded systems, 
                    but also to integrate the various devices for the functioning of the entire business system.With the advent 
                    of technology and advances in R&D, hardware engineering is now prevalent in newer fields such as mobile 
                    computing and distributed systems, computer vision and robotics, etc…Diploma holders in CHE branch can 
                    work areas like Hardware,Networking,programming , system admin  etc….AS in other diploma programmes 
                    short term and long term courses are available for higher studies/specialization.
                </p>

					The course is composed of core concepts in computer science, such as operating systems, databases, and mobile computing, 
		    		and also includes communication skills. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for various job roles. Students can opt to 
		   	 		pursue careers as software developers or go on to pursue higher education. A diploma in computer engineering will equip you 
		    		with the skills to program in a particular language, such as Java, Android, or web programming, and make you employable in the field. 
		    		The coursework covers a variety of software and hardware topics, teaching students how to code in Java and C++, as well as the theory of 
		    		programming languages, evaluation of algorithms, and design of computer-based systems.
