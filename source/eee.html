                    Electrical and Electronics Engineers are needed in private as well as govt, 
                    sectors Electrical and Electronics Engineering is an integrated branch of engineering .Electrical engineering is 
                    an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems 
                    which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It is predicted that the scope of electrical and 
                    electronics engineers will multiply largely in the core industries. . Electrical Engineering is a core branch 
                    of Engineering. It is an evergreen branch. Qualified Electrical Engineers are always in demand since most 
                    industries use electricity and electric machines. Engineers are required by industries for operational, 
                    maintenance and manufacturing purposes..Scope of EEE diploma holders will increase in coming years, 
                    due to increase in use of electrical vehicles and  solar power systems.
