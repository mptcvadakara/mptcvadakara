                    At the starting of the college we had a Medical Electronics branch, and from 2015 onwards, the branch was 
		    		renamed as Biomedical Engg., with a modification in the syllabus. 
                    In this diploma course, students will gain a strong base in electronics. They study Basic Electronics, 
                    Electrical Engg., Electronic circuits, Linear integrated circuits, Digital Electronics, 
                    Communication Engg., etc.. After that, the syllabus includes various imaging technologies, Therapeutic 
                    equipments, diagnostic equips, analytical equipments, and basics of hardware and networking. 
                    Candidates completing this course can work as biomedical engineers / service technicians 
                    in hospitals or biomedical equipment agencies. Many Biomedical alumni are working 
                    in organizations manufacturing biomedical equipments. Like all other diploma courses, 
                    short-term and long-term courses are available for biomedical diploma holders. Biomedical engineering 
					focuses on the advances that improve human health and health care at all levels.

            <h2>Objectives:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Biomedical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies principles of science, 
                    engineering design, and material science to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes.</li>
                <li>This stream of engineering is largely responsible for the design of sophisticated medical 
                    equipments such as diagnostic and therapeutic machines and lifesaving devices.</li>
                <li>The course teaches the candidates the fundamental principles of operation and format of analytical and diagnostic equipments.</li>
                <li>The main motive of the course is to train the students in research technologies that would 
                    bring out new medical cures and improve healthcare standards.</li>
                <li>Students, after the completion of diploma in biomedical engineering, are well-versed in the 
                    different dimensions involved in the field. They are hired as design engineers, marketing 
                    professionals, biomedical engineers, research engineers, quality control engineers, 
                    and much more in government and private firms.</li>
