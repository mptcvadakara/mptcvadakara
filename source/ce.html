                    A diploma in computer engineering or computer science engineering is a 10+3 level of academic programme. 
		    		It provides students with the basic knowledge of computer science, mathematics, computing techniques, and engineering concepts. 
		    		Students enrolled in the course acquire skills that help them to become an IT professional and enter the world of work. 
		    		The duration of the course is three years.
                </p>
				<p class="paragraph-indent">
                    The course is composed of core concepts in computer science, such as operating systems, databases, and mobile computing, 
		    		and also includes communication skills. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for various job roles. Students can opt to 
		   	 		pursue careers as software developers or go on to pursue higher education. A diploma in computer engineering will equip you 
		    		with the skills to program in a particular language, such as Java, Android, or web programming, and make you employable in the field. 
		    		The coursework covers a variety of software and hardware topics, teaching students how to code in Java and C++, as well as the theory of 
		    		programming languages, evaluation of algorithms, and design of computer-based systems.
