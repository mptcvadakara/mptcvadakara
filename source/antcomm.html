                        <p>Ragging’ means the doing of any act which causes, or is likely to cause any physical, psychological or physiological 
							harm of apprehension or shame or embarrassment to a student, and includes:</p>
                        
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Teasing or abusing of playing Practical joke on, or causing hurt to any student.</li>
                            <li>Asking any student to do any act, or perform anything, which he/she would not, in the ordinary course, be willing to do or perform.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Ragging is different from other crimes because the motive is solely to get perverse pleasure. Ragging is also different 
							from other crimes as it is actively promoted by certain sections of the society.</p>

                        <p>Ragging is a disturbing reality in the higher education system of our country. Despite the fact that over the years ragging 
							has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and has ruined careers of thousands of bright students, the practice is still perceived 
							by many as a way of ‘familiarization’ and an ‘initiation into the real world’ for young college-going students. Other 
							organisations/bodies working in this field have also attempted to define ragging, the variety of definitions 
							being reflective of differences in perspective.</p>
