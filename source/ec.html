                   Electronics Engineering (EE)  in polytechnic level involves 
                    designing, developing, and testing of electronic equipment used in various systems. ECE deals with basic electronics, 
                    microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analog communication, analog integrated circuits,
                    satellite communication, antennae, mobile communication and wave progression. It also deals with the 
                    manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment..ECE diploma holder  
                    having good knowledge skill can work in design, embedded system,communication,hardware & Networking, 
                    programming etc.Elctronics People accept electronics as a Job  in the beginning of 20th century, 
                    still applications of electronics  fast growing .We cannot imagine a world without electronics. 
                    If interested, ECE diploma students can be specialized in many areas like fiber optics, instrumentation, 
                    medical electronics ,robotics,mechatronics, remote infrastructure managing etcâ€¦..Various short term as 
                    well as long term courses are available for specialization and higher studies.
